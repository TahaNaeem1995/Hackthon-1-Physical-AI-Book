# Introduction to AI-Native Book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the AI-Native Book on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This educational resource provides a comprehensive understanding of Physical AI and humanoid robotics for beginner to intermediate AI/software learners.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**:

```shell
npx @docusaurus/init@latest init my-website classic
```

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```shell
cd my-website

npx docusaurus start
```

Your site starts at `http://localhost:3000`.

Open `docs/intro.md` and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and display your changes.
