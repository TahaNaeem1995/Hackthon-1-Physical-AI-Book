# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

This module focuses on physics simulation and environment building for humanoid robotics using Gazebo and Unity. You will learn how to create realistic simulations that accurately represent physical phenomena and human-robot interactions.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Simulate physics, gravity, and collisions in Gazebo
- Create high-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction in Unity
- Simulate various sensors including LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs
- Integrate simulation environments with physical robot systems

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of basic physics concepts
- Module 1: Foundations of Physical AI

## Navigation

This module contains the following chapters:
- [Chapter 4: Simulating Physics, Gravity, and Collisions in Gazebo](./chapter-4.md)
- [Chapter 5: High-Fidelity Rendering and Human-Robot Interaction in Unity](./chapter-5.md)
- [Chapter 6: Simulating Sensors: LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs](./chapter-6.md)

Let's begin with simulating physics in Gazebo.
