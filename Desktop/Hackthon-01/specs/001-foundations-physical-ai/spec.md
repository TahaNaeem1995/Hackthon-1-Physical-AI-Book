# Feature Specification: Module 1 — Foundations of Physical AI

**Feature Branch**: `001-foundations-physical-ai`
**Created**: 2025-12-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Module: Module 1 — Foundations of Physical AI

Audience:
Beginner to intermediate AI/software learners.

Purpose:
Establish core understanding of Physical AI and humanoid robotics.

Chapters:
1. What Is Physical AI
2. Evolution of Humanoid Robotics
3. Core Components of Physical AI Systems"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Understand Core Physical AI Concepts (Priority: P1)

As a beginner to intermediate AI/software learner, I want to understand the fundamental concepts of Physical AI so that I can build a solid foundation for more advanced learning in humanoid robotics.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational knowledge that all other learning in the module builds upon. Without understanding what Physical AI is, learners cannot progress effectively.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by presenting the "What Is Physical AI" chapter content and measuring learner comprehension through knowledge checks or assessments that demonstrate understanding of core concepts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a learner with beginner to intermediate AI/software background, **When** they complete the "What Is Physical AI" chapter, **Then** they can accurately define Physical AI and distinguish it from traditional AI approaches.

2. **Given** a learner reading the Physical AI chapter, **When** they encounter examples and explanations, **Then** they can identify real-world applications of Physical AI concepts.

### User Story 2 - Trace Evolution of Humanoid Robotics (Priority: P2)

As a beginner to intermediate AI/software learner, I want to understand the historical development of humanoid robotics so that I can appreciate current state-of-the-art approaches and future directions.

**Why this priority**: Understanding the evolution provides context for current technologies and helps learners appreciate the challenges and breakthroughs in the field.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by presenting the "Evolution of Humanoid Robotics" chapter content and measuring learner ability to identify key milestones and technological advances in humanoid robotics development.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a learner reading the evolution chapter, **When** they study historical developments, **Then** they can identify at least 3 major milestones in humanoid robotics and explain their significance.

### User Story 3 - Identify Core Components of Physical AI Systems (Priority: P3)

As a beginner to intermediate AI/software learner, I want to understand the essential components that make up Physical AI systems so that I can comprehend how these systems function and interact.

**Why this priority**: Understanding system components is crucial for learners to grasp how Physical AI systems are designed, built, and function in practice.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by presenting the "Core Components of Physical AI Systems" chapter content and measuring learner ability to identify and describe the key components and their functions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a learner studying Physical AI systems, **When** they examine component descriptions, **Then** they can identify at least 4 core components and explain their roles in the system.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when learners have varying levels of prior knowledge in AI and robotics?
- How does the system handle learners who want to skip foundational content they already understand?
- How do we accommodate different learning styles (visual, auditory, kinesthetic) in text-based content?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
