# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

This module explores the convergence of Vision, Language, and Action in modern robotics, focusing on how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be integrated with robotic systems to enable natural human-robot interaction and intelligent task execution. You will learn how to build systems that can understand natural language commands, perceive the environment, and execute complex robotic actions.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Integrate OpenAI Whisper for voice command processing in robotics
- Use LLMs to translate natural language into sequences of ROS 2 actions
- Implement Vision-Language-Action systems for intelligent robot behavior
- Build complete autonomous systems that respond to voice commands

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of ROS 2 basics
- Module 1: Foundations of Physical AI
- Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

## Navigation

This module contains the following chapters:
- [Chapter 10: Voico-Action: Using OpenAI Whisper for Voice Commands](./chapter-10.md)
- [Chapter 11: Cognitive Planning: LLMs to ROS 2 Actions](./chapter-11.md)
- [Chapter 12: Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid](./chapter-12.md)

Let's begin with implementing voice command processing using OpenAI Whisper.
