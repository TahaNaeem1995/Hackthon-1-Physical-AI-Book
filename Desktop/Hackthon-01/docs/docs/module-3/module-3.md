# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

This module focuses on advanced perception and training using the NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem. You will learn how to leverage NVIDIA's specialized tools for robotics, including Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation, Isaac ROS for hardware-accelerated perception, and Nav2 for advanced navigation.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Use NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
- Implement hardware-accelerated VSLAM (Visual SLAM) and navigation with Isaac ROS
- Apply Nav2 for path planning in complex humanoid movement scenarios
- Integrate AI models with robotic perception and navigation systems

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of basic robotics concepts
- Module 1: Foundations of Physical AI
- Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Navigation

This module contains the following chapters:
- [Chapter 7: NVIDIA Isaac Sim: Photorealistic Simulation and Synthetic Data Generation](./chapter-7.md)
- [Chapter 8: Isaac ROS: Hardware-Accelerated VSLAM and Navigation](./chapter-8.md)
- [Chapter 9: Nav2: Path Planning for Bipedal Humanoid Movement](./chapter-9.md)

Let's begin with NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation.
