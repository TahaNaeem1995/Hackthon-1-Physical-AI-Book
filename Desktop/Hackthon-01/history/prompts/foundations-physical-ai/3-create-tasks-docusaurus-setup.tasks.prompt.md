Generated comprehensive task list for Docusaurus setup and Physical AI documentation creation. Created tasks.md with 6 phases: Setup (T001-T004), Foundational (T005-T009), User Story 1 (T010-T014), User Story 2 (T015-T019), User Story 3 (T020-T024), and Polish (T025-T031). Tasks organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing. Each task follows checklist format with ID, story labels, and file paths. Includes dependencies and execution order information.
