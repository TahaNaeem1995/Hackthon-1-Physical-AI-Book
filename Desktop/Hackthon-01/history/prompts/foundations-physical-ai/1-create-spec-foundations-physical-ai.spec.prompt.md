## Prompt

Module: Module 1 — Foundations of Physical AI

Audience:
Beginner to intermediate AI/software learners.

Purpose:
Establish core understanding of Physical AI and humanoid robotics.

Chapters:
1. What Is Physical AI
2. Evolution of Humanoid Robotics
3. Core Components of Physical AI Systems

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification for Module 1 - Foundations of Physical AI, including user scenarios for understanding core concepts, tracing evolution of humanoid robotics, and identifying core components. Defined functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-005) focusing on providing clear explanations and structured content. Established success criteria with measurable outcomes (SC-001 to SC-004) including learner comprehension metrics and satisfaction ratings. Created quality checklist confirming all validation items pass.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete specification for educational module on Physical AI foundations
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md and requirements.md checklist in specs/001-foundations-physical-ai/
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed to planning phase with /sp.plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification addresses all required chapters with clear user journeys and measurable success criteria

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All required sections completed with testable requirements
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin planning implementation of the educational content
